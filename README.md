## Installation ##

Assuming GGG is installed and the GGGPATH environment variable is set.

If you ran GGGPATH/install/master.sh this code is already installed in GGGPATH/src/tccon_netcdf and you do not need to follow the steps below.


It can be installed manually, go to GGGPATH/install and run:
	
	./check_python.sh
	source ~/.bashrc
	./check_environment.sh
	./clone_netcdf_writer.sh

## write_tccon_netcdf/write_netcdf.py ##
Code to compile the outputs of GGG in a netCDF file

Run from the directory where the GFIT outputs are saved with:

	python /path/to/write_netcdf.py tavfile

Or if the installation script was use:

	$GGGPATH/bin/write_netcdf tavfile

The code can also be used to turn an existing .private.nc file into a .public.nc file if the private file is given as input:

	python /path/to/write_netcdf.py private_nc_file
